This program simulates a single quantum particle inside a bounded, reshapable 1D potential. The dynamics of this quantum particle are given by
|&psi;(t)> = U(t)|&psi;(0)>,
where t is time, |&psi;> is the wavefunction vector ket of the particle, and U(t) is the unitary time evolution matrix. Numerical solutions to this equation may be found using the Crank-Nicolson method. This method is derived in [Exercise 9.8 of Mark Newmann's Computational Physics](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/exercises.html) for the free particle case.

This project is indebted to the following modules: Numpy for numerical calculations, Sympy for symbolic computations, Matplotlib for graphing, and Tkinter for the GUI.

## Instructions:

Make sure that you have at least Python 3.6.5 with Numpy, Matplotlib and Sympy installed. Install these by running `pip3 install numpy matplotlib sympy`.  You may also optionally install Numba, which improves performance.  To install Numba, run `pip3 install numba`.

Obtain all the necessary code by cloning this repository or downloading it, then run the file `app.py`. You should see something like:

The graph displays the wavefunction &psi;(x) and the potential V(x). The top left corner displays a legend showing the Hamiltonian H of the system  and its x-axis boundaries, which extend from -0.5 to 0.5. Note that the units on the x-axis and all other units of measurement are not in metric units, but in [natural units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units), where all fundamental constants are set to one.

Use the mouse to draw a new shape for both the wavefunction &psi;(x) and potential V(x). To switch between reshaping the wavefunction or the potential, right click and select either `Reshape Potential V(x)` or `Reshape Wavefunction`.

The complex-valued wavefunction &psi;(x) is not physically meaningful, but its probability density \*&psi;(x)&psi;(x) is; switch to this view by clicking `View Probability Distribution`. Measure observables by clicking on the `Position`, `Momentum`, and `Energy` buttons. To view their expectation values and standard deviations, right click and select `Toggle Expectation Values`. To select a stationary state, first right click and select `Select Energy Level`. This presents a graphical view of each of the energy levels, where clicking on any one of these energy levels sends the wavefunction into the corresponding energy eigenstate. You can type in a new wavefunction &psi;(x) and potential V(x) in `Enter Wavefunction ψ(x)` and `Enter Potential V(x)` text boxes. You can also select a preset potential in the `Choose Preset Potential V(x)` drop-down menu. To clear the wavefunction, press the `Clear Wavefunction` button. To alter the speed of the simulation, move the `Animation Speed` slider. To close the application, press `QUIT`.

To get a plain Matplotlib animation without any GUI, either directly run `animation.py` or import it separately. If you import it, make sure that you are running Matplotlib in interactive mode, and that you create an instance of `QuantumAnimation`. You can then measure observables by using its methods `measure_energy()`, `measure_position()`, and `measure_momentum()`. To switch between a view of the wavefunction itself or its probability density, use the methods `display_probability()` or `display_wavefunction()`. To change the wavefunction or potential, use `set_wavefunction([new wavefunction])` and `set_unitary([new_potential])`, where `new_wavefunction` and `new_potential` can either be a string or a Numpy array.

The actual physics are contained in the classes `Wavefunction1D` and `UnitaryOperator1D`, which encapsulate the wavefunction and unitary operator. These are in the module `qm`.

For more content like this, have a look at the interactive quantum simulations written by [Daniel Schroeder](http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/software/), [Paul Falstad](http://www.falstad.com/qm1d/), and [PhET Colorado](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/legacy/bound-states). It were these simulations that inspired me to write my own in Python. Then have a look into the quantum mechanics module [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/), for a less GUI-based but more technical and in depth exploration of quantum mechanics. You may also want to try exercise 9.8 in the previously mentioned Computational Physics book by Mark Newman, as well as the other questions in this chapter.
